## Shop Editing Improvements

### Changes Made

1. **Optimized Shop Updates**: Modified shop editing to only send fields that have actually changed instead of the entire shop data.

2. **Added Change Tracking Utility**: Created `utils/changeTracker.ts` with functions to:
   - Track changes between original and modified data
   - Only return fields that have been modified
   - Handle deep object comparisons
   - Support arrays and nested objects

3. **Updated Components**:
   - `ShopFormModal`: Now tracks changes and only sends modified fields
   - `Shops.tsx`: Main shops page now uses change tracking for edits
   - `ShopInfoTab.tsx`: Shop details page now uses change tracking for edits

4. **Enhanced Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track:
   - Original values
   - Current values
   - Changed fields only
   - What's being sent to the backend

### Benefits

- **Reduced Network Traffic**: Only changed fields are sent to the server
- **Better Performance**: Smaller payloads mean faster updates
- **Improved Debugging**: Clear logging shows exactly what's being updated
- **Reduced Server Load**: Backend processes less data per update

### Technical Details

The change tracking works by:
1. Comparing original shop data with form values
2. Using deep comparison for objects and arrays
3. Only including fields that have actually changed
4. Always including the `_id` field for identification
5. Handling file uploads separately
